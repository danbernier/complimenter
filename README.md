# Complimenter

What does it do? It compliments you, and insults you.

Warning: the insulter can get kind of nasty.

# Wait, what?

This isn't really about me getting lots of compliments, or needing to insult
lots of people. Really!

It's actually an exercise in generating patterned text, along the lines of
the way that a PEG recognizes and parses text.

Eventually, I'd like to have two bots talking to each other: each generating
text along these lines, and parsing the other's English. We'll see.
